# Product_Return_Prediction_System_Dashboard
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of product return data, key performance indicators (KPIs), and predictive insights. The overall visual style is dark, using orange, brown, and green accents to highlight data.

This interactive dashboard serves as the final deliverable for the Product Return Prediction System for E-commerce project, visualizing both historical data and the results of the machine learning prediction model. The data is sourced from the final prediction output of the ML model.

### üí° Overview

This project delivers an end-to-end Machine Learning solution designed to predict the likelihood of product returns for an e-commerce platform. By analyzing historical sales, customer, and logistics data, the system provides proactive insights to reduce return costs, optimize inventory, and enhance customer satisfaction. The final output is an interactive dashboard built on the model's predictions.

| **Metric / Visualization**                             | **Insight Provided**                                                                 | **Actionable Takeaway**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Model Accuracy (0.91)**                             | Confirms the machine learning model's high predictive performance and reliability.  | Establishes trust in the predicted return probability for immediate decision-making.     |
| **Actual vs. Predicted Returns (Avg_Return_Probability: 0.30)** | Compares historical return trends (0.28 Actual Return Rate) with model predictions. | Measure the potential impact of high-risk items and track model calibration over time.   |
| **Predicted Return Risk vs. Total Revenue (Scatter Plot)** | Crucial for prescriptive analytics. Identifies high-risk, high-value product segments. | Prioritize mitigation efforts (better product descriptions, improved QA) for financially risky products. |
| **Shipping Duration vs Days to Return (Bar Chart)**   | Highlights logistical factors contributing to returns (e.g., peak returns at 4-day shipping). | Optimize logistics and packaging strategies for specific shipping durations.             |
| **Return by Category & Gender (Donut/Bar Charts)**    | Provides detailed demographic and category-level insights into return behavior.       | Inform decisions like tightening return policies or launching targeted marketing campaigns. |
| **Interactive Filters (Category, Year, Gender, Month)** | Enables dynamic data exploration across key dimensions.                              | Supports rapid root-cause analysis (e.g., ‚ÄúMen‚Äôs electronics returns in December‚Äù).     |
